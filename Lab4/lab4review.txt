Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable


3. Get the ids and names of customers who did not place an order through agent
a01.

Incorrect output
- This one needs a different logic approach


5. Get the ids of products not ordered by any customers who placed any order
through agent a07 in pid order from highest to lowest.

Incorrect SQL statement
- Missed a semicolon at the end


7. Get all customers who have the same discount as that of any customers in
Dallas or London

Incorrect SQL statement
- Your query produced an error!



8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- You did not submit a .pdf file!

- You discussed constraints, but not "check constraints". There is a
  difference. 


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure you have semicolons at the end of each of your queries. 
  Your query produced an error!

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
