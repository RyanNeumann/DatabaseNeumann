Correct output for all queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  select *
  from products
  where city not in ('Dallas', 'Duluth') and priceusd >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city NOT IN ('Dallas', 'Duluth')
    AND priceUSD >= 1;


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- You submitted a text file, that was not runnable, I had to convert your
  file to remove special characters (see below). Please check the file I
  created lab3.sql

- Make sure you use the correct single quote character! This ' instead of 
  this ’ or this ‘. There were several errors:
   ERROR:  unterminated quoted string at or near "'Dallas’)"
   LINE 1:  Select name, city from customers where city in ('Dallas’)
                                                                   ^
   ERROR:  unterminated quoted string at or near "'Tokyo’)"
   LINE 1: ...ect name from agents where city not in ('New York', 'Tokyo’)
                                                                        ^
   ERROR:  column "‘mar’" does not exist
   LINE 1:  select * from orders where mon in ('jan', ‘mar’)
                                                      ^
   ERROR:  unterminated quoted string at or near "'c005’)"
   LINE 1:  select * from orders where cid = ('c005’)
                                                   ^
- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
