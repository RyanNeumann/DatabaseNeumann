1. 

Evidence looks ok.

It is very hard to read the screenshots; the images are very small!


2.

Minimum knowledge of the terms primary key, candidate key, and superkey. Please
review this concepts.

The distinction between a superkey and primary key is deficient. Remember
that a primary key is a specific candidate key that uniquely identifies every
row. 


3.

You might have the wrong concept of what -nullable- means. Can a food/beverage
have no name?


4.

The ``frist normal form'' has nothing to do with primary keys. Please check
your notes and the textbook Chapter 6.1.

The ``access rows by content only'' rule explanation is wrong. Please check
your notes or the book Chapter 6.1.

The ``all rows must be unique'' rule is wrong, but the example is correct.
Please check your class notes or Chapter 6.1 of the textbook.
